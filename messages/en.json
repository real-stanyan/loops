    "title": "FAQs",
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "How much do your services cost?",
        "answer": "Our pricing depends on the project scope, channels involved, and your business goals. Most of our clients invest between AUD 3,000 - 15,000 per month, but we focus on outcomes rather than fixed retainers. Every proposal is customised to deliver measurable growth."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you ensure measurable results?",
        "answer": "We align every project with clear KPIs such as conversion rate, customer acquisition cost, and return on ad spend (ROAS). You'll receive real-time dashboards and weekly insights so you can see what's working and where we're optimizing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes your performance-driven approach different?",
        "answer": "Unlike traditional agencies that chase vanity metrics, we focus on business results. Through continuous A/B testing and creative iteration, we scale what performs and refine what doesn't — ensuring your budget drives actual revenue growth."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of creative content do you produce?",
        "answer": "Our creative team handles visual design, video production, photography, motion graphics, web design, and copywriting. Every asset is crafted to inspire engagement, conversion, and brand loyalty — not just look good."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you work with all business sizes?",
        "answer": "Yes. From emerging startups to established enterprises, we adapt our process to your needs. We can integrate seamlessly with your internal marketing team or act as your fully outsourced creative partner."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to sign a long-term contract?",
        "answer": "Not necessarily. We offer both short-term and long-term partnerships, depending on what best suits your needs and goals. Whether you start with a project-based collaboration or build an ongoing strategy, we're flexible. We believe the quality of our service naturally encourages clients to stay with us for the long term."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which digital channels are right for my business?",
        "answer": "That depends on your audience, goals, and positioning. We'll conduct a discovery session to evaluate your market, then recommend the ideal mix — from SEO and Google Ads to Meta, TikTok, email marketing, or influencer strategy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How soon can I expect to see results?",
        "answer": "Most clients notice early momentum within the first 3 months. The first month is dedicated to audit and strategy, the second to creative rollout and campaigns, and the third to scaling and optimization. Results compound over time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will I have visibility and control throughout the process?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. You'll have access to live analytics, monthly reports, and direct communication with your project lead. Transparency is at the core of how we work — you'll always know what's happening and why."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if results don't meet expectations?",
        "answer": "We treat your KPIs as our own. If key targets fall short, we'll proactively review the strategy, reallocate budget, and adjust direction. Our goal is to be a true partner in growth, not just another vendor.how we work — you'll always know what's happening and why."
